## Restated Program Goal
1. In code, get all the words within the words.json resource file into an object or data structure that you can manipulate
2. Log the number word length within all the "words" keys in the words.json file.
3. Print all distinct odd length words (which are lower-cased) with number of appearances
4. Sort the resulting odd length words from step 3 according to word length from smallest to largest 
5. Please include a README.md on how we can run your code and tests.

## Code added to also ...
1. count individual lowercased letters for all words
2. total number of words (prior to distinct or being made a set)


## To Try Out Code:
1. `git clone git@github.com:codeaperature/AmberData.git`
2. `cd AmberWords`
3. `sbt run`

## To Test:
1. Use Step 1 & 2 above if not already done
2. `sbt test`
